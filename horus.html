<p><a href="index.html">[Back Home]</a></p>
<p>This was published in the March and April 2019 editions of White Dwarf magazine, and it is the order I&#39;ve been following for the last few years. Because, let&#39;s face it, who has the time to read 60 something books? Not me! You probably don&#39;t even have time to read the abbreviated list below. But give it a go, maybe. If you want. I have only included the &quot;essentials&quot; - none of the side plots, none of the &quot;further related reading&quot;, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-crusade-era">The Great Crusade Era</h2>
<p>The opening trilogy perfectly sets the scene for everything that is to follow. The Great Crusade is drawing to a close and the Emperor returns to Terra, pronouncing Horus Warmaster...</p>

    <p>The loyal Primarchs begin to follow their own paths as they try to fight for mankind's freedom from tyranny. [A note from JP - this is a bit of a "choose your own adventure" style scenario
    in that you can follow the story of the Raven Guard, the Salamanders or the White Scars. You could choose all three, but the whole point of this list is to acknowledge that no-one has enough time for that.
    So, instead, I am choosing for you: the White Scars. If you really want to know what books are recommended for the Raven Guard and the Salamanders, well, ask me. I'll tell you.]</p>

     <li><em>Scars</em>, Chris Wraight (2014)</li>
