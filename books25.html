<p>Why, hello there. I just finished this book. It’s about technology! I often read books about technology. That’s right. Can I be any more specific? Yes! It’s a book about software development. MORE SPECIFIC? Okay, okay. It’s a book about software development at Apple in the 2000s. The noughties (ugh). Temba, his arms wide. It is about Safari, it is about the original iPhone and its keyboard.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perhaps my favourite of the books about software development that I have yet read. I think its quite narrow focus and relatively low page count helped in this regard. I didn’t have to learn the names of 50 different people, often a problem in these books. In fact, one of the remarkable things is how few people actually worked on the iPhone. 25, I think he said. But we didn’t have to learn the names of all of them. Phew.</p> 
<p>I see some people have complained about it “dumbing down” the tech stuff, but I personally appreciated the fact that the author actually wrote for a general audience, most of whom wouldn’t have a sodding clue about cascading style sheets. Sometimes I do actually need things dumbed down. You know?</p>
<p>It did make me a bit nostalgic for these “glory days” of Apple, and I think that was the author’s intent. Things just ain’t been the same since old Steve moved on. Bring back the 00s! Bring back 24! Bring back World of Warcraft! Bring back my ability to eat an entire large Pizza Hut pan crust pizza to myself without feeling sick! Bring it BACK.</p>

<p>The blurb/puff reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Kara Swisher, then a reporter at The Washington Post, was granted unprecedented access to one of the hottest and most closely watched companies in the world, America Online, Inc. In aol.com, Swisher has written a book that captures the secrets of how AOL beat the competition and became the world&#39;s biggest online company. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How fortunate I am to find this so amusing! For you, the internet is a mundane, functional tool. For me, it is the basis of an entire culture. </p>
<p>This book is one of the better of these endless &quot;books about 90s tech&quot; I keep picking up for pennies on eBay. For one, there was a lot of BRAND NEW (to me) INFORMATION about the fledgling internet of the 70s and 80s. The guy who essentially came up with AOL.com basically had the idea for Steam (i.e. digital game distribution) in the early 80s, except of course the tech was in no way ready and so it never got anywhere. Madcap stuff.</p>
<p>Secondly, I loved reading about all the legal back and forth, mass panic about paedogeddon, the internet&#39;s role in the demise of civilisation, and so on, which eventually lead to the passing of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act">Communications Decency Act</a>. Of course, as it turns out, they were right about the demise of civilisation, but they didn&#39;t correctly identify the cause. It&#39;s not paedos, it&#39;s electric car manufacturers. </p>
<p>And finally, yes, I enjoyed the triumphal note the book ended on. AOL.com was in a very strong position in the late 90s and everything was lovely. Just a passing mention of something called &quot;broadband&quot; which had the potential to mess up AOL&#39;s business model, but which they were pretty sure wouldn&#39;t catch on. I mean: (AO)LOL, right?</p>

    <h3>Dan Abnett, 2024</h3>
<p>16-Feb-25</p>
<p>Can I be frank? I read <a href="https://www.blacklibrary.com/all-products/ebook-the-end-and-the-death-volume-iii-eng-2024.html">this book</a>. It was almost 1500 pages long. Spoilers follow. But, in fairness, the plot of this book was set out in detail in the 2nd edition 40k rulebook, and set out again in even more detail (like, almost an entire page of A4) in the 2nd edition Chaos Codex. So, you should already know the plot.</p>
<p>Re-reading that Chaos Codex, I was struck by how closely the Horus Heresy series of novels has stuck to the original story. Obviously, there is a lot of elaboration. 64 novels versus a page or two. But a lot of the complaints I have seen on the web about this series are moaning that it has deviated too much from the original plot. But come on! COME ON! There are over sixty novels. Did you really think there wouldn't be the odd flourish?</p>
    <p>Damn, I have to work. Okay, quick thoughts: this final book in the series was far too long. The final battle between the Emperor and Horus went on far too long. Nonetheless, I still had a good time reading it. Not Abnett's best, but aside from the far-too-florid fight scenes this was a satisfying way to wrap things up. Oh, no spoilers after all. Okay, here's a spoiler: the Emperor kills Horus using a SPECIAL KNIFE. Ever been to Swindon Town FC for a game of football?</p>
    <p>PS, a reminder that the White Dwarf approved recommended reading list for the Horus Heresy is <a href="horus.html">available on this very website</a>.</p>
